# Gallery-ImageDownloadInHTML
A project purely in HTML where a Gallery is created and you can download an image of your choice from there. 
In this project , in index.html file , importance of having greenery that's by planting trees has been written in few paragraph . At the end of the index.html file , 
another webpage has been linked to the gallery icon.

Once you click on that icon , which has also been guided through symbol, then you will be directed to another webpage that is index1.html . At index1.html webpage , 
I have inserted few images which I have taken while having my trip . You can view the image from there and if you like then there will be a link provided below each image
to download the image.

So , basically this is the moto of this project and it has been purely made in HTML.
And if you like the project , please like it , it will be motivation for me as I am beginning my journey .
